# College Board Analysis Task 
Code and data used for College Board Data Analysis Task using the Global Longitudinal University Enrollment Dataset (GLUED).

## Dataset
https://github.com/cbshuang/cbds-take-home
The Global Longitudinal University Enrollment Dataset (GLUED) provides an unbalanced panel dataset of
estimated enrollment in roughly 17,000 universities in 194 countries and territories worldwide. Variables include country, university name, founding year, fields of study, degrees offered, and estimated student enrollments from 1950 to 2020 in 5-year increments.

## Analysis tasks
1) Please load the entire dataset. In the following, assume that the variable “iau_id1” identifies unique institutions and that enrollments are estimated by the variable “students5_estimated”. There is no need to incorporate any additional data sources.

2) What civil or geopolitical events do you think you might be able to detect with this data set? Create one of more visualizations and some basic analysis to make some initial observations about this event as it impacted university enrollments. It is ok if the event turns out not to be observable in the data.

3) Your client wants to know how GDP is related to university enrollment. Join the provided data set “Countries GDP 1960-2020.csv” onto the enrollments one and briefly describe the relationship you see.
